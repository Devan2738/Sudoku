OVERVIEW:

 This program reads in known values of a Sudoku puzzle from a text file and sets the values of Cell objects within a two-dimensional array to those values. This array represents a Sudoku puzzle. Three solution techniques are used to find and set the values of unknown numbers in
 the Sudoku puzzle. The solution steps used by this program and the possible values at the beginning of each new iteration of the solution techniques is printed to SolutionSteps.txt.
 This program can solve easy, medium , and some difficult Sudoku puzzles but cannot solve advanced Sudoku puzzles due to more complex solution techniques which would need to be included. SampleInput9.txt is an example of one of these more advanced puzzles which cannot be solved. All other included text files can be completed with no errors. This program is an ongoing project and these additional solution techniques will be pursued.

 
INCLUDED FILES:

 * Cell.java - source file
 * Solver.java - source file
 * README - this file
 * SampleInput1.txt
 * SampleInput2.txt
 * SampleInput3.txt
 * SampleInput4.txt
 * SampleInput5.txt
 * SampleInput6.txt
 * SampleInput7.txt
 * SampleInput8.txt
 * SampleInput9.txt
 * SolutionSteps.txt - contains information about solution steps and values set
 
 // Text files which are to be solved should be formatted according to the following example 
    ('0' represents an unknown value):
 
   9 9
   5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
   6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
   0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
   8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
   4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
   7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
   0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
   0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
   0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9

   
COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 This program can be run from within an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which accommodates the Java programming language, or from the command line. If using an IDE, confirm that the run configurations include a program argument, which needs to be the name of a provided text file in this project, or a text file created by the user which is formatted according the specifications found above in the 'INCLUDED FILES' section of this document.
 
 The following instructions are for command-line instructions in a Linux system.
 
 From the directory containing all source files, compile both classes with the command:
 $ javac *.java

 Run the Solver class file with this command:
 $ java Solver SampleInput1.txt
 
 // 'SampleInput1.txt' can be replaced with the name of another text file provided
 // by this project or a text file created by the user which is formatted according 
 // the specifications found in the 'INCLUDED FILES' section of this document.

 After the Sudoku puzzle is solved, information about the original and completed
 puzzle will be printed to the console.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 This program reads specifically formatted text files which represent unsolved Sudoku puzzles. This Sudoku puzzle is then solved and the solution is printed to the console.

 Several Sudoku puzzles tested were solved by only using the 'first solution technique,'
 as labeled within the Solver.java class. This technique sets a Cell object value 
 if there is only a single number from 1 to 9 missing in the union of Cell object values
 from the same row, column, or subgrid as the given Cell object. The Sudoku puzzles which
 were solved with only this method were considered easy.
 
 In order to solve the medium difficulty Sudoku puzzles, the 'second solution technique' was added to the main method in the Solver.java class. This technique differed from the first because it checked the numbers which were not possible in the same subgrid as a given Cell object.
 
 Solving a more advanced Sudoku puzzle was attempted, which is included in this project as SampleInput7.txt, but the current two solution techniques were not sufficient enough to solve this puzzle.
 
 More solution techniques will be researched and added to this program to make it possible for advanced Sudoku puzzles to be solved. After more difficult Sudoku puzzles of dimension 9x9 can be solved with this program, the efficiency of the solution techniques in Solver.java will be increased. Completion of this task will lead to working on accomodating puzzles of other dimensions, such as 10x10 or 14x14.

 
TESTING:

 After correcting all compile time errors, testing was done by incremental steps at 
 specific locations within the Solver.java class. Information about the number of values set, 
 the solution technique used, and the values in the grid array were printed to the console, 
 among other things. The logic errors took a majority of the debugging time to find and fix.

 
DISCUSSION:
 
 I plan on incorporating more solution techniques to this project in the future as I continue to develop my program, in order to be able to solve more advanced Sudoku puzzles. With the addition or two more of these new solution techniques, my focus will move towards increasing the speed of this Sudoku Sovler. The rows, columns, and subgrids of the grid array can be contained in a priority list and they would be indexed according to the number of Cell values already set within each of them. Rows, columns, or subgrids with closer to 8 known values can be solved faster than those with less known values.
